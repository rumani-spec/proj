List of the 4 bugs in html
Easy (Timer)

Bug: Start button id is start-time, but typical JS will query document.getElementById("start-timer").

Effect: Start button “does nothing” because the event listener never attaches.

Medium (Todo – form behavior)

Bug: Add button has type="submit" instead of type="button".

Effect: Clicking it submits the surrounding form or page (if you wrap it later), causing unwanted reload instead of just adding a todo.

Medium (Quiz – scoring logic target)

Intended: JS will probably read values by names q1, q2, q3 and compare to correct answers.

Combined with bug 4, this makes some answers not counted correctly.

Hard (Quiz – duplicated radio group name)

Bug: Third question radios use name="q2" instead of name="q3".

Effect:

Questions 2 and 3 share the same group, so only one of them can be selected at a time.

Any quiz-scoring code that expects q3 will never find an answer, leading to a wrong final score.

bugs in js 
Easy (Timer stop state)

timerId is never set back to null after clearInterval, so code cannot reliably know if the timer is running.

Medium (Timer multiple intervals)

Start handler always calls setInterval without checking timerId, so clicking Start repeatedly makes the timer speed up.

Medium (Todo input clear)

After adding a todo, todoInput.value = ' ' leaves a space instead of clearing the field completely.

Hard (Todo delete)

In the delegated click handler, todoList.remove() deletes the entire list instead of just the clicked item.

bugs in css
Easy – wrong selector name

.chalenge { … } should be .challenge { … }.

Effect: challenge sections are not styled as cards.

Medium – invisible button text

button { background: #0f172a; color: #0f172a; } uses the same color for background and text.

Effect: buttons look empty/disabled due to very low contrast.

Medium – over‑broad .done selector

.done { … } styles any element with class done, not just todo text.

Effect: anything that reuses done class in future will unexpectedly appear crossed out; there is also a specificity/confusion angle.

Hardest – invalid media query unit

@media (max-width: 600xp) uses xp instead of px.

Effect: responsive rule never applies, navigation never stacks on smaller screens, and it’s subtle because everything else looks fine
